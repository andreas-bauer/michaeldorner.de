Therefore, we first need to understand the foundations of international taxation in the context of globally distributed software engineering, before we can discuss how Microsoft addressed tax compliance and where the fundamental problem lies.\nFoundations of International Taxation for Software Engineers # Let\u0026rsquo;s dramatically simplify, Microsoft consists of only two legal entities: Microsoft US and its subsidiary Microsoft Ireland. (In fact, there are two more relevant subsidiaries for this case: Microsoft Operations Puerto Rico and Microsoft Asia Island. We select Microsoft Ireland only as the mechanics are similar.) The developers in the US employed by Microsoft US develop only one product, the operating system Windows, jointly with their Irish colleagues employed by the Irish subsidiary Microsoft Ireland. Microsoft Ireland then sells Windows across all of Europe. Without any further consideration, solely Microsoft Ireland generates profits, which are then fully taxed in Ireland according to Irish law. The US tax authorities (IRS) are left out in the cold because Microsoft US has no share of the profit that could be taxed in the US, although Microsoft contributed significantly to the product that made the success of Windows possible.\nTo avoid this scenario and to provide a common ground for international taxation, reducing uncertainty for multinational enterprises, and preventing tax avoidance through profit shifting, nearly all countries in the world agreed on and implemented the so-called arm\u0026rsquo;s length principle as defined in the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations.\nThe arm\u0026rsquo;s length principle is the guiding principle and the de-facto standard for the taxation of multinational enterprises that requires associated enterprises to operate as if not associated and regular participants in the market from a taxation perspective. This principle ensures that transfer prices between associated companies of multinational enterprises are established on a market value basis and not misused for profit shifts from high to low tax regions.\nTo comply with the arm\u0026rsquo;s length principle, Microsoft US and Microsoft Ireland need to operate from a taxation perspective as if they were not associated. Since a regular participant in the market would not provide code contributions, whole components, code reviews, tests, architectural designs, or other contributions free of charge to a closed-source software project, Microsoft Ireland needs to pay for the received contributions, the so-called transfer price.\nTransfer prices are the prices at which an enterprise transfers physical goods and intangibles or provides services to associated enterprises. Since software is intangible itself, the transfer of intangibles like source code, components, code reviews, bug reports, etc., is our focal point. This transfer price guarantees that Microsoft US gets its share of the profit, which then can be taxed by the US tax authorities.\nIn the following figure, we provide a schematic overview of transfer pricing from our simplified example. Although Microsoft US contributed significantly to Windows, the product that is sold in Europe, without a transfer price, Microsoft US has no share of profits; all profits are fully taxable in Ireland only. However, if Microsoft Ireland pays a transfer price reflecting the value of the services and intangible properties received from its associated enterprise in the US, Microsoft US realizes profits which then are taxable in Sweden.\nA schematic overview of the necessity and mechanics of transfer pricing: Without considering a market-based compensation, the so-called transfer price, Microsoft US has no share of the profits which could be taxed by the IRS; all profits from the European customers are with Microsoft Ireland and, therefore, all taxes stay within Ireland. So, how do we now determine a transfer price? The OECD knows five different approaches to determining transfer prices. Microsoft applied one of them, the so-called cost contribution arrangements or short CCA.\nAt this point, we make two simplifications for didactic reasons we would like to explicitly disclose: (1) The IRS regulations refer to cost sharing arrangement (CSA). In this blog post, we follow the terminology of the OECD Guidelines and refer to CCA. For the sake of this article, they can be assumed to be synonyms. (2) The OECD guidelines know two types of CCAs: Service CCA and Development CCA. Although both are relevant in the context of software engineering, we focus on Development CCA in this article. In the software engineering context and in layman\u0026rsquo;s terms, a CCA is a contractual arrangement between subsidiaries to share the assets (software or data) and risks involved in joint development. Each participant of a CCA has rights to the assets shared in the CCA. These rights usually allow the participant to use the assets in a specific region or for a particular purpose. If a participant has rights to any property developed by the CCA, they do not need to pay royalties or other fees to use it (i.e., a transfer price), as long as their contributions are in line with their expected benefits. If not, additional so-called balancing payments are necessary.\nThe Microsoft Case # Now that we understand the core principles by reference to our simplified setup, we can now look into the actual case. Please note that we heavily rely on the article by Curtis and Avi-Yonah from 22023 who published a detailed account of the Microsoft case in Tax Notes International in March 2023 for this article because detailed information on the tax audit itself is not publicly available. However, the careful and thorough analysis by Curtis and Avi-Yonah allows us to draw conclusions on Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s tax compliance approach for their software engineering and why the tax audit escalated.\nThe controversial point boils down to one question: Is Microsoft Ireland a legit participant of the CCA or is Microsoft shifting profits from the US, where the intellectual property, i.e., the software was actually created and developed, to Ireland and profiting from a corporate income tax there?\nAlthough Microsoft Ireland made a $7 billion buy-in payment to join the CCA in 1999, has about 2000 employees from 71 different nationalities and the local administrative support functions, such as finance, human resources and sales \u0026amp; marketing for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa also appear consistent with the economic substance, the IRS reckons that Microsoft Ireland is a legit participant of the CCA. From the IRS\u0026rsquo; perspective, \u0026ldquo;appeared to play little if any role in the production side of the exploitation activities for the [Windows] [\u0026hellip;] and primarily performed marketing, sales, and support functions\u0026rdquo;. Like any tax authority, the IRS is allowed to adjust the transfer price where the prices charged are outside an arm\u0026rsquo;s length range in accordance with the OECD guidelines. Such an adjustment will carry interest and might be coupled with penalties. In the wake of the OECD\u0026rsquo;s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project, the regulatory framework has become considerably stricter at an international and national level. As a result, the IRS demands $28.9 billion from Microsoft.\nWhy does the IRS reckon Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s CCA and Microsoft Ireland as a legit participant of the CCA? There are two main assumption about the software engieering of Windows.\nThe first assumption is captured by the following quote from Curtis and Avi-Yonah: \u0026ldquo;Windows operates flawlessly for most users with each successive version because the new version consists only of new programming added to the prior versions with a continuous rolling process of development, testing, launch, and patching. In other words, any new version of Windows is basically the previous version with new features layered onto it in a rigorous testing environment. As a result, the Windows source code has an extremely long decay rate for transfer pricing purposes.\u0026rdquo; Following this line of reasoning, the value attributable to ongoing software development is comparatively low and the value of previously developed software is high. Undervaluing legacy intellectual property, stipulating artificially low (non-arm’s length) buy-in payments, constitutes an important way to shift substantial IP-based profits offshore. However, there are good counterarguments for undervaluing the continuous development activities from a software engineering perspective:\nFirst, maintaining legacy software is known to be costly, problem-prone, and requiring extra care. For example, older programming languages like C and C++, the dominant programming languages used for the development of Windows, are known for being prone to vulnerabilities that are based on memory errors. Although there are many approaches for mitigating memory errors in C and C++, those memory issues are still the root cause of about 70% of all security vulnerabilities. Modern programming languages inherently protect software from such memory errors and, thus from bugs or vulnerabilities based on memory errors. Thus, we find it difficult to agree that Windows is only a core of legacy (previously developed) software with layers of new features added on top of it.\nSecond, the perspective neglects the differentiation between interface and implementation, a core principle of software engineering. Microsoft, commensurate with this core principle, is known to carefully avoid changes to Windows APIs while further developing and improving Windows. Every change in how Windows interacts with applications that run on it potentially creates malfunctions in applications that worked seamlessly in an older Windows version. However, keeping these interfaces intact is mostly independent of changing the underlying implementation. The assumption that \u0026ldquo;any new version of Windows is basically the previous version with new features layered onto it\u0026rdquo; may be right for interfaces; but needs to be substantiated for (costly) implementations. As a consequence, the IRS might risk overvaluing the legacy IP.\nThe second argument that significant contributions to Windows come only from the headquarters in Redmond might be counterintuitive for modern software engineering. Modern software development at an industrial scale like in Microsoft is becoming increasingly integrated, collaborative, and self-organized. This manifests for example in the industry-wide adoption of new software development paradigms such as DevOps (where teams are organized to have capabilities both in developing and operating a software system) or inner source (where teams open their development work to contributions from other teams). Microsoft is a prominent and outspoken proponent of these paradigms. For example, they started adopting inner source practices as early as 2008. In a recent talk, Microsoft claims that 10% of work contributions within Microsoft’s firm-internal GitHub platform come from teams who are not responsible for the code they are contributing to. In such a setup, where developers routinely pick their own tasks, it seems far-fetched that developers from certain national entities are solely assigned trivial work.\nWe also know that developers at Microsoft communicate extensively through code review beyond team boundaries, which indicates that their software engineering is heavily driven by self-organization and collaboration.\nTax Compliance as Software Engineering Problem # One might agree or disagree with our counterarguments, taking sides with the IRS or Microsoft. But the fundamental problem for our Microsoft case and all cases that will follow: Everything is an argument, a line of reasoning, based on assumptions or best guesses. Looking at balance sheets like tax officers tend to do, does not answer the question of whether a participant of a CCA is a legit participant contributing significantly to the software or not. What would answer this question are empirical measurements of the software and software engineering. This makes tax compliance a software engineering problem.\nAs software engineers, we have the means and competence required to address this uncertainty and can provide empirical measurements to answer the pressing questions for future tax audits. This makes tax authorities a new stakeholder in software engineering. To provide meaningful insights into the software engineering reality for tax audits, we software engineers, however, must better understand the (non-technical) perspective of tax authorities. Addressing tax compliance on an international level is way more complicated than this blog posts article with its dramatic simplifications and shortcuts may suggest.\nIf want to learn more, read our article published in Tax Notes International and more to come for software engineers.

It feels unfortunately backwards as a result.\n— Reviewer 1 from a prestigous software engineering journal\nIn this blog post, I explain (not only to reviewer 1 from a prestigious software engineering journal 🙄) the differences and, more importantly, the interplay between exploratory research and confirmatory research.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with graphical approach to the (pragmatic) empirical research cycle involving both exploratory (theory-generating) and confirmatory (theory-testing) research.\nTwo Sides of the Same Coin # Exploratory research begins with specific observations, distills patterns in those observations, and derives theories from the observed patterns using inductive reasoning. The nature of exploratory research enables to analyze chosen cases and their contexts in great detail, but also leads to limited generalizability as they are drawn from those specific cases (especially when there is little relation to existing evidence that would allow for generalization by analogy). As such, it remains susceptible to researcher bias due to the absence of an already existing theory.\nConfirmatory research, in turn, begins with a theory, makes predictions (often in the form of hypotheses), and evaluates whether those predictions hold true or not in empirical observations. To build a robust body of knowledge, we obviously need both exploratory and confirmatory research following complementary research methods (and qualitative and data) to minimize bias and maximize the validity and reliability of our theories efficiently.\nBackwards and Forwards # We clearly see that reviewer 1 from the quote above was expecting an exploratory study, while we designed a confirmatory one. The choice of research method in our study could have given him a hint: How would you conduct an experiment with hypotheses (predictions) without an initial theory? The fact that we could not confirm our theory is not a valid reason for rejection.\nTikZ Code # In case the text or the figure above is helpful for your paper or your rejoinder, feel free to use the text and the TikZ graphic:\n\\documentclass[border=2mm]{standalone} \\usepackage{charter} \\usepackage{tikz} \\usepackage{xcolor} \\definecolor{blue}{RGB}{0, 114, 178} \\definecolor{red}{RGB}{213, 94, 0} \\begin{document} \\begin{tikzpicture} \\foreach \\a/\\t in {90/Theory, 0/Prediction, -90/Observation, -180/Pattern}{ \\node (\\t) at (\\a:2cm) {\\textbf{\\t}}; } \\draw[-latex, thick, red] (90-25:2cm) arc (90-25:0+10:2cm); \\draw[-latex, thick, red] (0-10:2cm) arc (0-10:-90+30:2cm); \\draw[-latex, thick, blue] (-90-30:2cm) arc (-90-30:-180+10:2cm); \\draw[-latex, thick, blue] (-180-10:2cm) arc (-180-10:-270+25:2cm); \\draw[latex-, thick, blue] (-3.5,2) -- (-3.5,-2) node[blue, midway, anchor=north, rotate=90] {Inductive reasoning} node[blue, midway, anchor=south, rotate=90] {Exploratory research}; \\draw[-latex, thick, red] (3.5,2) -- (3.5,-2) node[red, midway, anchor=south, rotate=90] {Deductive reasoning} node[red, midway, anchor=north, rotate=90] {Confirmatory research}; \\end{tikzpicture} \\end{document} ","date":"May 17, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/michaeldorner.de/posts/exploratory-vs-confirmatory-research/","section":"Posts","summary":"In this blog post, I explain the differences and, more importantly, the interplay between exploratory research and confirmatory research.","title":"Exploratory vs. Confirmatory Research","type":"posts"},{"content":"Modern software systems are often too large, too complex, and evolving too fast for single developers to oversee. Therefore, software engineering has become highly collaborative. Often, engineers and their teams collaborate across borders, especially in multinational companies with subsidiaries spread around the globe. Such collaboration has an often overlooked legal implication: the profits from those cross-border collaborations become taxable.\nNow that we understood the foundations and the challenges in tax compliance for software engineering from the previous blog posts of this series, it is time to answer the question of all questions: Is cross-border collaboration and, therefore, also the taxation of it, a real issue?\nApproximating Cross-border Collaboration # To estimate the prevalence of cross-border collaboration, we measure cross-border code reviews as proxy for cross-border collaboration in a typical industrial setting. A cross-border code review is code review with participants from more than one country. Although it originated in collocated, waterfall-like code inspections, its modern stances are lightweight and asynchronous discussions among developers around a code change. Different tools are in use, for example, Gerrit or Github and Gitlab with their implementation of code review as so-called pull and merge requests, respectively. Although code review is by far not the only type of collaboration that may include taxable transactions and is also likely not sufficient to determine company-wide transfer prices, the following characteristics make code review a suitable first proxy for cross-border collaboration:\nMore than code only: Code review not only includes the actual code change and its authors but also includes the feedback from reviewers that may have formed or changed the code change significantly but is no longer visible in the repository after merging the code change into the code base. Therefore, our proxy goes beyond existing code-based measurements for collaboration. Accessible \u0026amp; complete: The code review discussions are (company-internally) public by default and are, thus, accessible. Unlike other tools like instant messaging services or e-mail, code review does not split into public and private, whose analysis may cause privacy concerns. Persistent: Code review tools are the backbone of modern code review and ease data extraction. Other types of code review (for example, private or synchronous discussion around a code change through meetings or instant messaging) may not be captured through the tooling, though. Measurement # We measured the share of cross-border code reviews at a multinational company delivering software and related services worldwide with main R\u0026amp;D locations in three countries. For many years the company has tried to allocate products to particular sites to avoid the burden of cross-border collaboration. However, our analysis shows that developers represent more than 25 locations because the new corporate work flexibility policy permits relocations. The company uses a single, central, and company-wide tool for its internal software development and code review. Understandably, our case company wants to remain anonymous. Therefore, we are not able to describe the case any further. However, we believe that our case company is exemplary for a multinational enterprise developing software.\nWe provide a replication package to reproduce our results for any GitHub Enterprise instance. Due to the sensitive topic, we are not able to share our data. From the code review tool, we extracted all code reviews that were completed in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 including their activities. All bot activities were removed and were not considered in our analysis. We then modelled code reviews as communication channels among code review participants. We consider a code review as a discussion thread that is completed as soon as no more information regarding a particular code change is exchanged (i.e., the code review is closed). We complement each code review participant with the information of the country of the employing subsidiaries at the time of the code review.\nResults # The share of cross-border code review at our case company in the years 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 (black line) monthly sampled. Since not all historical locations of all code review participants could be reliably retrieved, the share of cross-border reviews could be more significant (indicated by the red area). The figure above shows an increase in relative cross-border code reviews over time. The share of cross-border code reviews was between 6% and 10% in 2019 and 2020. Yet, we see a further steep increase reaching between 25% and 30% at the end of 2022.\nInterestingly, 6% of all cross-border code reviews involve participants from more than two countries. This means transfer pricing in collaborative software engineering becomes not only a bilateral but a multilateral problem with not only two but multiple—in our case company up to six—different jurisdictions and tax authorities involved in the transfer pricing process.\nAlthough the share of cross-border collaboration may vary among companies, yet, our findings suggest that—through the proxy of cross-border code reviews—cross-border collaboration becomes a significant part of daily life in multinational software companies. It is fair to assume that a further increase in cross-border collaborations in software engineering will draw the attention of tax authorities.\nConclusion # On the one hand, the arm\u0026rsquo;s length principle is the de-facto standard for multinational enterprises that any multinational company must comply with. On the other hand, software engineering is highly collaborative; beyond geographical and organizational boundaries. Determining a reasonable transfer price for this cross-border collaboration brings the general challenge of taxing intangibles to a new level of complexity.\nPretending to be dead for tax reasons is no option because ignoring the significant cross-border collaboration in modern software development, as we exemplarily found, is a slippery slope: Cross-border collaborations in software engineering will draw the attention of tax authorities. Also, ceasing or forbidding all cross-border collaboration in software engineering is not a valid solution: Reversing the collaborative nature of modern software engineering is likely too costly and takes too long.\nObviously, there are neither simple solutions for such a complex and interdisciplinary problem, nor a single article that can solve this complex problem potentially affecting every software-developing company with developers employed by subsidiaries in more than one country. However, our article aims to bring this eminent and unsolved problem of taxing collaborative software engineering to the audience that can solve this issue. As a software engineering community, we will need to find a common understanding of what constitutes taxable transactions and each company that develops software collaboratively within more than one country needs to learn how to track and value cross-border collaboration, how to estimate the transfer pricing, and how to report these to the tax authorities to be compliant.\nGot you excited?

Therefore, software engineering has become highly collaborative. Often, engineers and their teams collaborate across borders, especially in multinational companies with subsidiaries spread around the globe. Such collaboration has an often overlooked legal implication: the profits from those cross-border collaborations become taxable. In this second blog post in our series on tax compliance in software engineering, we will discuss the unique and fundamental challenges of taxing collaborative software engineering.\nFrom the last blog post, we understood that companies must pay a transfer price for goods, intangibles, or services transferred in a multinational enterprise to comply with the international standards on taxation. So, what are transfer prices for collaborative software engineering that comply with this Arm\u0026rsquo;s Length Principle? Determining a market price for intangibles is inherently difficult and is reflected in a broad price range. Collaborative software engineering, however, scales the problem of a transfer-price determination to a new level of complexity because the reality of modern software engineering is significantly more complex than our introductory example above may suggest. Since transfer price regulations apply to a much broader definition of intangibles compared to accounting standards, the latter can not be used as a reliable measure of value for transfer pricing purposes.\nThere are three main high-level challenges for transfer pricing in collaborative software engineering within multinational enterprises. The figure below illustrates the complexity in modern collaborative software engineering at devnullsoft Group (the fictitious multinational company from introduced in the previous post of this series) and where those three challenges apply.\nThe challenges for tax compliance in modern collaborative software engineering Challenge 1: What is a taxable transaction in software engineering? # The trouble for transfer pricing in software engineering begins with a fundamental question: What is actually a taxable transaction in the context of collaborative software engineering? It is not immediately clear what types or characteristics classify a taxable exchange of intangibles or services across the boundaries of a country in the context of software engineering.\nAmong other potentially relevant types of taxable intangibles, such as goodwill or group synergies, this blog post focusses on two types of intangibles that are highly relevant for software engineering: know-how and licenses.\nThe OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines define know-how as the \u0026ldquo;proprietary information or knowledge that assist[s] or improve[s] a commercial activity, but that [is] not registered for protection in the manner of a patent or trademar\u0026rdquo;. The commercial activity includes the manufacturing, marketing, research and development of and for a software system.\nDoes the OECD definition imply that all types of information exchanged during collaborative software engineering are know-how? On the one hand, yes, since all information is proprietary and, to some extent, contributes to the software being developed or its engineering processes. But on the other hand, how do we know which information assists or improves the commercial activity, meaning the engineering of the software system, over time? For example, a quick and dirty bug fix without sufficient documentation or testing may improve the software system in the present but makes changes more costly or even impossible in the future.\nThe second type of intangibles highly relevant to transfer pricing in software engineering if transferred across borders is licenses. Although maybe not even explicit, the company-internal use and reuse of components is an instance of licensing. Complex software systems are not monolithic blocks of code but consist of components that are developed, shared, and reused by separate teams. However, we lack a common understanding of software components and reuse in software engineering for taxation. Not every component is directly used for or in a software-intensive product, but maybe adds value to the product. For example, a well-engineered CI/CD pipeline accelerates the development cycles and brings new features or bug fixes faster to the customers. Furthermore, it is also not always clear who owns, contributes to, or uses a component within a company, and the roles may even change over time. In contrast to open source, the reuse is often implicit, lacking a company-wide license agreement that clarifies the responsibility and accountability between component owners and users. Even worse, we do not even know if our definition and understanding of code ownership suffices the definition of ownership in a taxation context.\nAdditionally, we see an interplay between those two types of intangibles, know-how and licensing, since they may be two sides of the same collaboration. For example, when code contributions from a component user support instances of reuse.\nInsight: Identifying the taxable transactions requires either a holistic perspective of software engineering or at least suitable, practical, and accurate proxies. Compliant software engineering needs a common understanding and a taxonomy of taxable transactions specific to software engineering. Challenge 2: How to track cross-border transactions in software engineering? # Also, the practical tracking of taxable know-how and licensing (and potentially other types of intangibles) is a challenge on its own.\nTracking know-how is an inherently difficult task. Since the teams collaborating are no longer colocated, numerous tools enable an exchange of know-how in software engineering. Those tools are suitable as rich data sources to different extents: While domain-specific tools like issue trackers or collaborative software development platforms like GitHub or Gitlab often track the exchanges very thoroughly, other communication and collaboration tools do not: Online meetings, for example, can facilitate an exchange of taxable intangibles, but this exchange is not tracked by any tool. But even if there is a rich data basis available, leveraging those data sources is problematic for following reasons:\nEstablishing location: It can be difficult to establish the location of collaborators or capture when a location of a collaborator has changed, because organizations often preserve only the latest version of the organizational structures. Privacy: Analyzing the complete communication of developers may be perceived as a measure of surveillance, which raises ethical and legal concerns related to privacy. In contrast to the potentially rich sources for tracing taxable transactions from collaboration tools used in software engineering, tracking company-internal reuse often lacks a solid data basis. Although companies often track the reuse of external open-source components for open-source license compliance purposes, those tools are rarely used or suitable for tracking company-internal reuse. Also, only reuse that crosses borders is taxable; information that is often not available or stored over time, although component ownership is not static and may be subject to change.\nInsight: Data for tracking taxable transactions may be incomplete, faulty with respect to location, or restricted. There is no dedicated tool support yet for the practical transfer price determination. Challenge 3: How to value taxable transactions in software engineering? # While it is inherently difficult to tax intangibles in general, things are even more complicated in software engineering. Potentially taxable intangibles cover a large range of granularity: They may be as large as a microservice providing user authentication which itself is used by microservices of other teams (see intangible licenses) or as small as a code change, code review, or bug report (see intangible know-how). Although the code change or feedback in a code review is small—maybe even only one line of code, like in the case of the Heartbleed security bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library from 2014—the potential impact on the software system can be tremendous or even fatal. A software change or a code review delivers value through impact, not size.\nThe same applies to licensing. The number of use relations of a software component or its size (however defined) does not reflect the value provided to the software-intensive product. While the software component for user authentication may be important for operating the software-intensive product and, therefore, has a large amount of depedent software components, it is not differentiating and may even be considered a commodity.\nThis means we cannot simply use purely quantitative measurements for transfer pricing. However, the sheer mass of small, fine-grained transactions of all types makes a human qualitative case-by-case evaluation impossible.\nInsight: A purely quantitative valuing can hardly reflect the value of transactions; however, a purely qualitative assessment does not scale with the magnitude of cross-border transactions in modern software development. Transfer pricing requires a tool-supported processes that assists tax and software engineering experts.

Therefore, software engineering has become highly collaborative. Often, engineers and their teams collaborate across borders, especially in multinational companies with subsidiaries spread around the globe. Such collaboration has an often overlooked legal implication: the profits from those cross-border collaborations become taxable.\nIn this first blog post in our series on tax compliance in software engineering, we start with a gentle introduction to international standards in multinational taxation and its basic Arm\u0026rsquo;s Length Principle from a software engineering perspective. And no worries, no prior knowledge or background is needed. In the following blog posts of this series, we will then discuss the unique challenges of taxing collaborative software engineering and we show the need for tax compliance in collaborative software engineering by approximating cross-border collaboration through code review.\nA Simplified Example # Let\u0026rsquo;s start with a fictitious multinational enterprise called devnullsoft Group that develops and sells a software-intensive product. devnullsoft Group has two legal entities: devnullsoft GmbH in Germany and its subsidiary devnullsoft AB in Sweden. The German development team employed by devnullsoft GmbH develops the software jointly with their Swedish colleagues employed by the Swedish devnullsoft AB. The German devnullsoft GmbH sells the resulting product to customers.\nThe Underlying Problem # Without any further consideration, solely the German devnullsoft GmbH generates profits, which are then fully taxed in Germany according to German law. The Swedish tax authorities are left out in the cold because devnullsoft AB has no share of the profit that could be taxed in Sweden, although devnullsoft AB contributed significantly to the product through code contributions, code reviews, bug reports, tests, architectural decisions, or other contributions that made the success of the software possible.\nThe Arm\u0026rsquo;s Length Principle # To avoid this scenario and to provide a common ground for international taxation, reducing uncertainty for multinational enterprises, and preventing tax avoidance through profit shifting, nearly all countries in the world agreed on and implemented the so-called Arm\u0026rsquo;s Length Principle as defined in the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations. The Arm\u0026rsquo;s Length Principle is the guiding principle and the de-facto standard for the taxation of multinational enterprises. It requires associated enterprises to operate as if they were not associated to another and, from a taxation perspective, are regular participants in the market. This principle ensures that transfer prices between associated companies of multinational enterprises are established on a market value basis and not misused for profit shifts from high to low tax regions.\nTo comply with the Arm\u0026rsquo;s Length Principle, devnullsoft GmbH in Germany and devnullsoft AB in Sweden must operate from a taxation perspective as if they were not associated. Since a regular participant in the market would not provide code contributions, code reviews, tests, or architectural designs free or other contributions of charge to a closed-source software project, devnullsoft GmbH in Germany needs to pay for the received contributions, the so-called transfer price.\nTransfer Prices # Transfer prices are the prices at which an enterprise transfers physical goods and intangibles or provides services to associated enterprises. Since software is intangible itself, the transfer of intangibles like source code, code reviews, bug reports, etc., is our focal point. This transfer price guarantees that devnullsoft AB gets its share of the profit, which then can be taxed by the Swedish tax authorities.\nThe Mechanics of transfer pricing for multinational enterprises In the schematic overview above, we summarize the mechanics of our fictitious company of transfer pricing between the two associated software companies from our example. Although devnullsoft AB contributed significantly to the software-intensive product, without a transfer price, devnullsoft AB has no share of profits; all profits are fully taxable in Germany only. However, if devnullsoft GmbH in Germany pays a transfer price reflecting the value for the services and intangible properties received from its Swedish associated enterprise, devnullsoft AB realizes profits, which then are taxable in Sweden. The Arm\u0026rsquo;s Length Principle is upheld.\nThe Dark Side # The devnullsoft Group does not artificially shift profits to a tax haven. Yet, one can easily imagine that neglecting to charge arm\u0026rsquo;s length prices can be intentionally misused for profit-shifting. Therefore, the OECD guidelines permit tax authorities like the Swedish tax authority to adjust the transfer price where the prices charged are outside an arm\u0026rsquo;s length range. Such an adjustment will carry interest and might be coupled with penalties. In the wake of the OECD\u0026rsquo;s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project, the regulatory framework has become considerably stricter at an international and national level. As a result, tax authorities can demand more comprehensive information to detect misalignments and enforce tax adjustments. From the companies\u0026rsquo; perspective, its software development may be (intentionally or unintentionally) non-compliant and face the risk of being legally prosecuted.\nThe Challenges # Now that we understand the underlying mechanics of tax compliance and the transfer price at arm\u0026rsquo;s length as its guiding principle, read the next blog post in this series, where we discuss the tax compliance challenges specific to software engineering.\nThis series is based on our research article Taxing Collaborative Software Engineering published as open-access at IEEE Software.

Although reported by qualitative studies, our understanding of the capability of code review as a communication network is still limited.\nObjective: In this article, we report on a first step towards understanding and evaluating the capability of code review as a communication network by quantifying how fast and how far information can spread through code review: the upper bound of information diffusion in code review.\nMethod: In an in-silico experiment, we simulate an artificial information diffusion within large (Microsoft), mid-sized (Spotify), and small code review systems (Trivago) modelled as communication networks. We then measure the minimal topological and temporal distances between the participants to quantify how far and how fast information can spread in code review.\nResults: An average code review participants in the small and mid-sized code review systems can spread information to between 72% and 85% of all code review participants within four weeks independently of network size and tooling; for the large code review systems, we found an absolute boundary of about 11000 reachable participants. On average (median), information can spread between two participants in code review in less than five hops and less than five days.\nConclusion: We found evidence that the communication network emerging from code review scales well and spreads information fast and broadly, corroborating the findings of prior qualitative work. The study lays the foundation for understanding and improving code review as a communication network.\nDownload # Download PDF Replication Package # michaeldorner/information-diffusion-boundaries-in-code-review Replication package for \u0026ldquo;Upper Bound of Information Diffusion in Code Review\u0026rdquo; Jupyter Notebook 7 15 Meta # DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2306.08980 arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08980 Publisher: Springer ","date":"January 3, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/michaeldorner.de/publications/information-diffusion-in-code-review/","section":"Publications","summary":"Michael Dorner, Daniel Mendez, Krzysztof Wnuk, and Jacek Czerwonka","title":"The Upper Bound of Information Diffusion in Code Review","type":"publications"},{"content":" Preprint - submitted to EMSE Authors # Michael Dorner, Maximilian Capraro, Oliver Treidler, Tom-Eric Kunz, Darja Šmite, Ehsan Zabardast, Daniel Mendez, and Krzysztof Wnuk\nAbstract # Background: The company-internal reuse of software components owned by organizational units in different countries constitutes an implicit licensing across borders, which is taxable. This makes tax authorities a less known stakeholder in software architectures.\nObjective: Therefore, we investigate how software companies can describe the implicit license structure of their globally distributed software architectures to tax authorities.\nMethod: We develop a viewpoint that frames the concerns of tax authorities, use this viewpoint to construct a view of a large-scale microservice architecture of a multinational enterprise, and evaluate the resulting software architecture description with a panel of four tax experts.\nResults: The panel found our proposed architectural viewpoint properly and sufficiently frames the concerns of taxation stakeholders. However, unclear jurisdictions of owners and potentially insufficient definitions of code ownership and software component introduce significant noise to the view that limits the usefulness and explanatory power of our software architecture description.\nConclusion: While our software architecture description provides a solid foundation, we believe it only represents the tip of the iceberg.

The discussion participants can leverage this information in the following code reviews; the information diffuses through the communication network that emerges from code review. Traditional time-aggregated graphs fall short in rendering information diffusion as those models ignore the temporal order of the information exchange: Information can only be passed on if it is available in the first place.\nAim: This manuscript presents a novel model based on time-varying hypergraphs for rendering information diffusion that overcomes the inherent limitations of traditional, time-aggregated graph-based models.\nMethod: In an in-silico experiment, we simulate an information diffusion within the internal code review at Microsoft and show the empirical impact of time on a key characteristic of information diffusion: the number of reachable participants.\nResults: Time-aggregation significantly overestimates the paths of information diffusion available in communication networks and, thus, is neither precise nor accurate for modelling and measuring the spread of information within communication networks that emerge from code review.\nConclusion: Our model overcomes the inherent limitations of traditional, static or time-aggregated, graph-based communication models and sheds the first light on information diffusion through code review. We believe that our model can serve as a foundation for understanding, measuring, managing, and improving knowledge sharing in code review in particular and information diffusion in software engineering in general.\nDownload # Download PDF Replication Package # michaeldorner/only-time-will-tell Only Time Will Tell: Replication package Jupyter Notebook 3 1 Meta # DOI: 10.1145/3544902.3546254 arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07291 Publisher: https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544902.3546254 ","date":"September 20, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/michaeldorner.de/publications/only-time-will-tell/","section":"Publications","summary":"Michael Dorner, Darja Smite, Daniel Mendez, Krzysztof Wnuk, and Jacek Czerwonka","title":"Only Time Will Tell: Modelling Information Diffusion in Code Review with Time-Varying Hypergraphs","type":"publications"},{"content":" Video # Slides # Download slides ","date":"October 13, 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/michaeldorner.de/talks/information-diffusion/","section":"Talks","summary":"Invited talk at Maxkompetens in Växjö, Sweden","title":"Information Diffusion: Towards understanding, modelling, and improving communication in Software Engineering","type":"talks"},{"content":" The Researcher # Software is neither visible nor tangible, yet it defines how we live, work, teach, learn, and research.

I am particularly interested in the foundations of software engineering (for example, providing solid measurements for answering the questions) and bringing those foundations into practice (for example, to better understand and improve code review, to ensure tax compliance for software engineering). Although part of my work is qualitative, I love to crunch numbers, dig into large datasets, and apply all sorts of data analysis. In particular, I am an enthusiast of simulations as an empirical research method in and for software engineering research.\nIn my research, I have the privilege to collaborate with outstanding scientists and prestigious companies like Google, Microsoft, Spotify, Siemens, Ericsson, BlackDuck (now Synopsis) and Trivago around the world.\nAs an passionate advocate for open science, all of my studies are freely available. For the studies of which I am the first author, I publish preprints, provide extensive replication packages, and make code and data (to the extent legally and ethically possible) publicly available.\nThe Entrepreneur # Together with an interdisciplinary team of researchers, we discovered that collaborative software engineering is actually taxable if the collaboration crosses national borders.
