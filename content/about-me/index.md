## The Researcher

I love coding. I see beauty in code. Of course, not every code sparks joy, but nicely drafted, well-engineered software does. But what is well-engineered software? How can we make better software? Finding answers to those fundamental questions of software engineering is at the core of what motivates me. I am particularly interested in two omnipresent aspects of modern software engineering: [code review]({{< ref "/research/code-review" >}}) and [open source]({{< ref "/research" >}}). Both are unique to software engineering and have a long history of existing research. Yet, their stories have not been told entirely.

Although part of my work is qualitative, I love to crunch numbers, dig into large datasets, and apply all sorts of data analysis. In particular, I am an enthusiast of [simulations]({{< ref "/research/simulation" >}}) as an empirical research method in and for software engineering research.

Of course, my research is not a one-man show. I am grateful for working with the most brilliant researchers around the world and extraordinary industry partners. In different contexts, intensities, and research projects, I had the pleasure of working with Microsoft, Spotify, Facebook, Google, Trivago, Ericsson, Siemens, Continental, BlackDuck (now Synopsis), and others.

As an advocate for [open science]({{< ref "/research/open-science" >}}), all of my studies are freely available. For the studies of which I am the first author, I publish preprints, provide extensive replication packages, and make code and data publicly available.

## The Entrepreneur

Together with an interdisciplinary team of researchers, we discovered that [collaborative software engineering is actually taxable if the collaboration crosses national borders]({{< ref "/research/tax-compliance-in-software-engineering" >}}). We found out that:

- We are the first to describe and aim to resolve tax compliance for software engineering.
- Traditional taxation methods do not scale for fine-grained and massive collaboration in software engineering.
- Tax compliance in software engineering requires dedicated tool support, which does exist on the market.

I am thrilled to be part of this journey to develop a software solution for tax compliance in software engineering at [Kolabri](https://www.kolabri.io).

## The Consultant

Not everything is research. I work as a software engineering consultant at [Capraro Dorner](https://www.caprarodorner.de), a consulting company I co-founded with my dear colleague [Maximilian Capraro](https://www.capraro.net). We offer tailor-made consulting services around open source and inner source for companies.

Learn more about our services at [www.caprarodorner.de](https://www.caprarodorner.de).

## The Human Being

I am the father of two wonderful kids, who are everything to me. When not in front of a computer, you can likely find me swimming, running, or hiking to compensate for my passion: delicious food. And from time to time, I touch a piano inappropriately with my band [Klaf√ºnf](https://www.klafuenf.com).
