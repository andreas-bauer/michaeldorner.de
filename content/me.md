I love coding. I see beauty in code. Of course, not every code, but nicely drafted, well-engineered code sparks joy and makes me smile and happy. So I started my career after my master's as a data scientist and software engineer at Siemens Healthcare. What a wonderful time there! I am still proud of working with the most brilliant and kindest engineers to push the boundaries of distributed machine-learning systems for audio signal processing. However, despite the sheer competence and the restricted medical context, I was convinced: We can build better software and software better. So I went back to academia for a broader understanding of software engineering. After several years in academia now, I understand more and more: We just have started this journey and we've still got a long way to go.
