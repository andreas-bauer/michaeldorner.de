On this page, I would like to give you a vision of what I think software engineering could look like in the future and how we got there.

## My vision of software engineering

All of my research is driven by understanding software engineering. 


## Simulations as research method in software engineering

I am a huge fan and advocate of in-silico experiments and simulations in and for software engineering research.
