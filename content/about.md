## The author

I love coding. I see beauty in code. Of course, not every code, but nicely drafted, well-engineered code sparks joy and makes me smile and happy. So I started my career after my master's as a data scientist and software engineer at Siemens Healthcare. What a wonderful time there! I am still proud of working with the most brilliant and kindest engineers to push the boundaries of distributed machine-learning systems for audio signal processing. However, despite the sheer competence and the restricted medical context, I was convinced: We can build better software and software better. So I went back to academia for a broader understanding of software engineering. After several years in academia now, I understand more and more: We just have started this journey and we've still got a long way to go.


## The blog

I blog primarily for the following three motativation:

1. **Disseminate my [research]({{< ref "tags/research" >}}):**
I love to work on the fundamentals of software engineering, searching for the foundation on how we build better software and how we build software better. In academia, we communicate through publications that encode (novel) knowledge and information. This way of encoding knowledge and information follows patterns and (should) often contains a necessary but lengthy discussions of prior work and to what extent the findings are credible. However, this makes scientific publications often hard to digest. Therefore, I slice [my publications]({{< ref "tags/publication" >}}) into smaller, easily digestible blog posts. I also enhance the publications with observations and engineering challenges that have yet to make it into the publication. 

2. **Improve software engineering research:** 
I strongly believe that [in-silico experiments and simulations]({{< ref "tags/simulation" >}}), as well as [replication studies]({{< ref "tags/replication" >}}), can help our field advance. I discuss why and how in-silico experiments can help to improve software engineering research. In particular, both persepctives require a better understanding of software engineering and data analysis in research, away from an ad-hoc data analysis that is often considered as by-prodcut, often not shared at all or not meant to be shared with others, to a more engineering-driven and collaborative understanding of data analysis and scientific software. For that, I introduce to advanced topics in data analysis and modelling, quality assurance in data analysis and simulations-based studies, and considerations for replication studies. 

3. **Improve myself:** Like software engineering, I am convinced I have yet to reach the global optimum and neither my personal, local optimum in presenting, writing and disseminating my ideas, beliefs, and findings. Through continuous writing, I try to become a better researcher and a better teacher. 

Let me know what you think and reach out!
